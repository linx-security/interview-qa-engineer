# Web Application Infra Testing Assignment

## Objective
To assess the candidate's ability in writing automated tests and controlling the infrastructure running it.

## Requirements

1. Add a command to the package.json that runs the dev command and then the E2E tests
2. Write a basic test (get the browser running, find a specific element doesnt matter which) and fail or pass it based on the result.
3. Configure another "env" so the base url will be localhost:4000 (complies to the "stg" command) in the package.json
4. Setup allure reporting
5. Add accessability testing 
6. Implement a [costume reporter](https://webdriver.io/docs/customreporter/) The final report should include:
    <br> 
    a. Number of tests that passed
    b. Number of tests that skipped
    c. Number of tests that failed (and a list of the tests the failed)
